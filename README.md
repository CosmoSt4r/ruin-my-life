# Ruin my life

A simple C++ script to ruin code and make your life a nightmare

(or your ~~imaginary~~ friends')

Script replaces semicolons with greek question marks and vanilla
spaces with space characters

## Installation

Clone the script and compile it (e.g. using g++)  

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CosmoSt4r/ruin-my-life
  cd ruin-my-life
  g++ main.cpp -o ruin.exe
```
    
## Usage

You have to pass paths to files as command line parameters. 
Don't forget to add double quotes if path has spaces.

```bash
ruin "C:/Users/User/my-project/main.cpp"

> File opened successfully at C:/Users/User/my-project/main.cpp
> File ruined successfully at C:/Users/User/my-project/main.cpp
```

#### ~~Enjoy!~~ Watch your compiler go crazy!
